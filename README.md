Description: This is a game where you do things and stuff.

How to play
-----------
[The game is hosted here](http://students.cis.uab.edu/spencers/65535-Hackathon-Game/static/)

If you want to play it offline you can fork it and start the node.js server by installing the dependencies (`npm install`) and then start the server (`node server.js`).

You can then go to localhost:8080 in a web browser to play.

Controls
--------

W / Up: Thrust forward
S / Down: Thrust backwards slowly
A / Left: Turn left
D / Right: Turn right

Spacebar: Fire your weapon. (Hold it down for maximum effectiveness)

Directions
----------

You are to fly around in your spaceship defeating the green UFOs. You have to hit them with five bullets with your cannon before they will explode. They shoot at you too, so watch out.

Destroying rocks gives you more health, but you can only have a maximum of five. 

Hint: The UFOs shoot at where you are NOW. If you keep moving perpendicularly to their line of sight then you'll be much safer.
